          <h2>Project 3</h2>
          <h2>Small Bar City</h2>
          <p>This project was the first time our class was presented with the challenge of a goup project.</p><p>My group colleagues were <strong>Melanie Braun</strong>(left) and <strong>Sylvia Luk</strong>(middle).</p>

                The project required us to:
                </p>  
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Attract new customers</em> </li>
                        <li><em>Further engage existing customers</em></li>
                        <li><em>Create a <strong>mobile solution</strong> for the client</em></li>
                    </ul>
              </div>
        <div class="right">
         <p>was catered to help the students practice these three particular skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Data Analysis and Synthesis</em></li>
                <li><em>Teamwork</em></li>    
                <li><em>Persuasive presentation</em></li>    
            </ul>
        </div>
            <p>After our lecturers presented us with the project brief, we were told to select a target client who would become our primary target audience. Clients such as: </p>
              <p><strong>Allan's Billy Hyde</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mojo's record store</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The SG bar</strong></p>
              <p>etc ...</p>
              </div>
          
          <p>The client that we chose was <strong>The SG bar</strong></p>
           <img src="thebarSG.jpg" alt="The Bar SG" width="70%" height="600">
          <p>The first half of the project was comprised of a lot of research including <strong>Contextual Inquiry</strong>, <strong>Interviews</strong>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13YEDKjt-jOda5PYTCQ_398VvTPjoiloiTii9c6SQxzc/edit#responses" alt="Surveys"><strong>Surveys</strong></a>.</p>
          <p>The culmination of the results from our Surveys and the multiple sessions of Contextual inquiries lead to the discovery of some good responses and findings.  </p>
          <p>These findings consisted of information pertaining to people's motivations and habits during the process of going to a bar and searching for bars. </p>
          <p>From our <strong>findings</strong>, we discovered that</p>
          <ul>
              <li>91% of people go bars to meet friends or to socialise</li>
              <li>57% of people go to bars after work </li>
              <li>75% of people said that they like going to small bars</li>
              <p><strong>HOWEVER</strong></p>
              <li>Over 55% of people didn't know enough about <em>Small Bars</em> and would've liked to know more about their locations and what they're about</li>
          </ul>
          <p>____________________________________________________________________</p>
          <h3>Opportunity rather than Problem</h3>
          <p>After gathering our findings, we came together summarized the results that we had been able together.</p>
          <p>This was one of the more important times that we synthesized our research as it paved the way for the direction that we would take our project.</p>
          <p>The client (The SG bar) wasn't too fussed about expanding their social media footprint i.e creating a website catered to the needs of both the client and potential customers who sought to know more about the SG</p>
          <p>This was because they liked the adventure that came with people's curiosity when they wanted to find a small bar such as <strong>THE SG</strong>.</p>
          
           <p>____________________________________________________________________</p>
          <h3>User Personas</h3> 
          <p>From all the research we had conducted, we then thought of methods that would be neccessary to begin ideating solutions.What we saw as neccessary was the creation of <q>User Personas</q> as this would allow us to create fictional characters with real (general) characteristics that our research subjects had.</p>
          <p>This User persona was one that I named <strong>Janice</strong>.</p>
